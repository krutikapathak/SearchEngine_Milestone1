Yet, some of Olmsted stories began before his arrival at 99 Warren Street. Olmsted\u0027s Civil War service brought him into contact with many national figures of the day, including President Lincoln. Other stories may be only legends, like the tale of Captain Kidd\u0027s Treasure.   We will be posting more stories over the next few months so come on back for a visit soon!","url":"https://www.nps.gov/frla/learn/historyculture/stories.htm","title":"Frederick Law Olmsted National Historic Site: Stories"}
