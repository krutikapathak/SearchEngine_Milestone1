One persistent misconception is that the canal was owned by the B\u0026O Railroad during this period. This is not exactly true.  In 1889 the C\u0026O Canal Co. entered bankruptcy. Its \"receivers\" - entities that the C\u0026O Canal Company was in debt to - were responsible for the operation and maintenance of the canal until 1938. In 1938, the canal was sold to the United States Government for $2 million, which was paid to the B\u0026O Railroad as the primary holders of the 1844 and 1878 bond mortgages. The B\u0026O Railroad was the primary creditor of the canal.
