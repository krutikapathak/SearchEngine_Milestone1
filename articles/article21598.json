Clark remained an enigma for over a century, seemingly lost to the annuls of time. Now for the first time, park historian John Branson sheds light on the park\u0027s namesake in this biography of a pioneer of nineteenth century western Alaska.   Though his early years remain largely obscure, his adult life offers a fascinating glimpse into nineteenth century Alaska as it emerged from the control of Russia and became part of the United States. Clark was a participant of many important enterprises in western Alaska, beginning by at least the summer of 1866 in St. Michael. He was one of the first permanent Euroamerican residents of Alaska, the first permanent English-speaking resident in the Bristol Bay region, and one of the very first resident \"snow-birds\" of Alaska.
