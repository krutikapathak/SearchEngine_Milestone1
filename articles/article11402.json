USS Cassin Young bears the name of a navy commander awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions at Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Commander Young was in command of the repair ship USS Vestal which was moored alongside battleship USS Arizona. When USS Arizona blew up, he was blown overboard along with many members of his crew. With USS Vestal taking on water from several hits and set afire from the blazing inferno that had been USS Arizona, the remaining crew began to abandon ship.   Just as the first of the crew began to flee \"a figure, like some sea creature, rose from the water and stood athwart the gangway. It was Ted Young... \u0027Where the hell do you think you\u0027re going?\u0027 he asked the first sailor. \u0027We\u0027re abandoning ship,\u0027 the sailor replied. \u0027Get back aboard,\u0027 Young roared, \u0027You don\u0027t abandon ship on me!\u0027\" Commander Young got the fires under control, picked up survivors from USS Arizona and managed to move USS Vestal across the harbor where he beached her for later salvage.   After the attack on Pearl Harbor, Cassin Young was promoted to captain and given command of the heavy cruiser USS San Francisco. On the night of November 12-13, 1942, during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Captain Young died amidst an avalanche of shellfire from three Japanese warships. For his conspicuous gallantry in the face of the enemy, he was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. USS Cassin Young (DD793) was commissioned in 1943, honoring this gallant officer.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/bost/learn/historyculture/cassinyoung.htm","title":"Boston National Historical Park: Cassin Young, Capt., USN"}
