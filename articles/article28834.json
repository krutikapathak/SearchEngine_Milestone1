{"body":"Explore This Park    Plan Your Visit           Plan Your Visit       From 1875 to 1980, southwestern Pennsylvania was the Steel Making Capital of the World, producing the steel for some of America\u0027s greatest icons such as the Brooklyn Bridge and the Empire State Building. During World War I and II, our steel workers carried a nation\u0027s defense on their backs, producing more steel, armor and armaments in a single year than entire countries. While many of the region\u0027s legendary mill sites have been dismantled, and it has been decades since the mills belched fire and smoke over Pittsburgh\u0027s skyline, the enormity of the region\u0027s steel-making contributions and its historical significance to the nation demand its story be told and its sites be preserved.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/rist/planyourvisit/index.htm","title":"Rivers Of Steel National Heritage Area: Plan Your Visit"}
