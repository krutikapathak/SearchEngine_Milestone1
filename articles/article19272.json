During the fall and winter of 1998-1999, park staff assembled a cross-disciplinary group of teachers from Iowa, Minnesota, and Wisconsin to prepare these lesson plans. We thank each of them (P.J. Heinz, Debbie Moen, Lester Neeb, and Tracy Van Hyfte) for their hard work and dedication to this project. We also thank web page designer Emily Van from EJVDesigns for her inspiration and creativity in constructing the original On-Line Lesson Plan \u0026 Teacher\u0027s Guide.
