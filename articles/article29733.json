Several downtown streets are one-way, so be careful before you turn.  Franklin Street, which is used to access the Site parking lot, is one-way north-bound near the Site. School bus and tour bus parking is located on Delaware Avenue directly in front of the Site.  There is no available parking onsite for large campers or RVs.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/thri/planyourvisit/trafficandtraveltips.htm","title":"Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site: Traffic \u0026 Travel Tips"}
