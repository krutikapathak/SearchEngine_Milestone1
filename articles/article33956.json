{"body":"Virtual Tour Stop, Heth\u0027s Salient        By mid-afternoon on May 12 the fighting at the Muleshoe Salient had reached an impasse. By coincidence, both sides focused attention on another bulge in the Confederate lines known as Heth\u0027s Salient. General Grant ordered General Ambrose Burnside to attack Heth\u0027s Salient at the same time as General Lee ordered General Jubal Early to attack Burnside\u0027s left flank. In doing so, he hoped to relieve pressure on the Confederates at the Bloody Angle.         The 17th Michigan Regiment was among the Union units badly hurt in the fighting. They lost 200 men in 30 minutes. On May 10, 1997, this monument was dedicated to their memory.          Rebuilt logworks in Lee\u0027s Last Line   Continue to Virtual Tour Stop, Lee\u0027s Last Line","url":"https://www.nps.gov/frsp/learn/photosmultimedia/heth.htm","title":"Fredericksburg \u0026 Spotsylvania National Military Park: Heth\u0027s Salient"}
