{"body":"Abert\u0027s Squirrel         Abert\u0027s squirrels favorite food is the cones of Ponderosa pine trees. NPS Photo by Sally King  Abert\u0027s squirrels are unique mammals found anywhere in the monument where there are enough Ponderosa pine trees to supply their nutritional needs. Identified by their dark gray backs with a red-brown patch, white bellies, and long fluffy white tails the most destinctive feature of Abert\u0027s squirrels are their big tufted ears. Abert\u0027s squirrels feed on the cones, buds, and twigs of Ponderosa pine trees as well as fungus and tree sap. With no apparent fear of heights, they can often be seen high in trees scurrying from branch to branch looking for food.        Abert\u0027s squirrels rotate Ponderosa Pine cones as they eat them much like we rotate an ear of corn when we eat it. NPS Photo by Sally King  Feeding Habits Abert\u0027s squirrels favorite food is the cones of the Ponderosa Pine. They will turn the cone slowly, much like you may rotate an ear of corn as you eat it, peeling away the cone scales to reach the meaty seeds. The new buds and inner bark of the Ponderosa are also quickly consumed by the squirrel. You may think this would be bad for the Ponderosa, however, Abert\u0027s also eat ectomycorrhizal fungi. A byproduct of this feeding activity spreads the spores of the fungi around. As it turns out this fungi is very beneficial to the survival of the Ponderosa and the Abert\u0027s squirrel serve a vital function in the proliferation of the fungi. The relationship between plant and animal is very interesting and complex.        Mule deer quickly eat the Ponderosa pine twigs dropped to the ground by feeding Abert\u0027s squirrels. NPS Photo by Sally King  Abert\u0027s Squirrels and Mule Deer The eating habits of Abert\u0027s squirrels also prove beneficial to mule deer. When the squirrels eat the buds and shoots of the Ponderosa pine they chew off whole twigs. The uneaten portion they drop to the ground many feet below. You can tell where Abert\u0027s squirrels have been active by the debris below the Ponderosa pines. The mule deer seem to relish this tree-top treat and quickly consume the messy Abert\u0027s trash.        Abert\u0027s squirrels build nests high in Ponderosa pine trees and line them with pine duff to make warm homes. NPS Photo by Sally King  Squirrel Nests, Not Bird Nests Abert\u0027s squirrels build nests high up in Ponderosa pine trees. The nests look similar to a large, messy bird nest. The Abert\u0027s collect plant materials including pine duff to line their lofty abode and create a warm, snuggly home. Here, in late spring or early summer, female Abert\u0027s give birth to their tiny, pink hairless babies. Young Abert\u0027s emerge from these sanctuaries by August and begin to collect food for the winter along side their parents.        In early spring Abert\u0027s squirrels can be seen eating the maple syrup-like sap of boxelder trees. NPS Photo by Sally King  Sweet-toothed Abert\u0027s In early spring, just as the sap begins to flow in the trees, Abert\u0027s squirrel have an interesting addition to their diets. You can often spot an Abert\u0027s squirrel clinging to the side of a boxelder tree licking the bark, and the gooey sap below, with their tongue. Boxelder trees are members of the maple family, and have a sweet sap similar to maple syrup. Abert\u0027s Squirrels may have developed a sweet tooth by eating this high-energy treat, if only for a short period in the early spring.        During summer months, adult Abert\u0027s Squirrels shed their distinctive ear tufts. NPS Photo by Sally King  A Summer Coat In summer, Abert\u0027s Squirrels shed their distinctive tasseled ears and their thick winter coat. Since an Abert\u0027s ears are still somewhat larger than other squirrel\u0027s ears, they still have a very unique appearance. When baby Abert\u0027s Squirrels emerge from the nest in late summer, they can easily be distinguished from their parents because they will already have the ear tufts they will continue to wear through the long winter months.
