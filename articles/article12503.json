{"body":"Climate Friendly \u0026 Cool Parks                 From seashores and lakeshores to glaciers and deserts, the impacts of climate change are already taking their toll on our national and state parks. As stewards of these resources, the National Park Service and California State Parks are taking a leading role in climate change response. Through the Climate Friendly Parks and Cool Parks programs, Redwood National and State Parks is assessing and reducing its contribution to climate change while educating staff and visitors about its impacts. These actions help preserve our natural and cultural treasures for future generations.      Visit Climate Friendly Parks online at www.nps.gov/climatefriendlyparks To learn more about Cool Parks, visit www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id\u003d24872 Also check-out Do Your Part!—an interactive online program for park visitors and supporters with information and tools to understand and reduce their carbon footprints and thereby help to protect our parks from climate change: www.doyourpartparks.org                    Climate Friendly \u0026 Cool Parks   6 Photos  Some of the more visible actions Redwood\u0027s already taking towards becoming a Climate Friendly Park","url":"https://www.nps.gov/redw/learn/management/climate-friendly-parks.htm","title":"Redwood National and State Parks: Climate Friendly \u0026 Cool Parks"}
