{"body":"Steam locomotives excited the senses and Steamtown works to keep their stories alive!  You\u0027d feel heat from the firebox, smell hot steam and oil; you\u0027d hear the whistle, feel the ground vibrate, and watch as one-ton drive rods turned steel wheels. Remember the sound of \"chuff-chuff\" from the smokestack? Today, you can learn the history of steam railroad transportation, and the people who built, repaired and rode, as we work to preserve a special era in America\u0027s industrial history!
