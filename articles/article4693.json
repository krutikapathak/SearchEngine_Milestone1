His 1,400 acre farm, most of which was covered by forest, made him the largest landowner in Morristown. Henry Wick\u0027s trees attracted Washington\u0027s army to the area as a winter encampment site because they needed logs to build cabins for shelter and wood to burn for heating and cooking. During the winter of 1779-1780 the army chopped down over 600 acres of his trees on Mr. Wick\u0027s property and more on neighbor\u0027s property. Additionally, Major General Arthur St. Clair, commander of 2,000 Pennsylvania soldiers, made his quarters in Mr. Wick\u0027s home for the winter. Today the house is open top the public and is furnished to portray its use as a general\u0027s headquarters.         Grand Parade - Originally the Grand Parade was an open field 400 yards long and 100 yards wide. A two-room log cabin located there served as the camp administrative center from which orders were issued and court-martials were held. Two cannon stationed here served as alarm guns to alert the camp of attack. Guards assembled daily on the Grand Parade for inspections and to receive their orders. The Grand Parade also served as a place for military executions; two soldiers were hanged and buried here.         1930\u0027s image of Guerin House   Guerin House - Joshua Guerin, his wife and 8 children lived in a small house on an average size farm of 76 acres. Guerin served as a sergeant in the Morris County militia and occasionally hauled supplies in his wagon for the army. He allowed the army to graze horses in his pasture and sold hay and firewood to the army. Soldiers were even briefly quartered in his house. Like many of his neighbors Guerin\u0027s property also suffered damages from the army\u0027s encampment. Soldiers stole potatoes, rye, sheep, tools and even some of his wife\u0027s clothing. Additionally, soldiers burned his fences and let horses loose in his wheat field resulting in the loss of half his crop. The house currently is used by park staff as a residence and is not open to the public.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/morr/learn/historyculture/jockey-hollow.htm","title":"Morristown National Historical Park: Jockey Hollow"}
