This information focuses on the Wright brothers\u0027 work in Dayton, Ohio, which led to the invention of free, controlled and sustained flight in a power-driven, heavier-than-air machine. Included is background information on the Wright brothers with guided questions, teacher instructions and six student activity sheets. Supplemental materials included are a list of Web sites and books, an Aviation Trail brochure and Dayton area map. Here you can download the full and complete teacher\u0027s guide.
