{"body":"Industrial Calumet        Calumet \u0026 Hecla Mining Operations from Swedetown Hill circa 1900(object placeholder)  Â    The Calumet and Hecla (C\u0026H) Mining Company grew from humble beginnings into the largest and most successful copper mining company in the Lake Superior region. C\u0026H\u0027s success and fortune was due mainly to it\u0027s location on the copper-rich Calumet Conglomerate Lode. C\u0026H\u0027s mine shafts and surface operations were constructed to effectively extract the copper-bearing ore.   Though quiet today, numerous structures remain in this former industrial landscape that allow visitors to connect with the stories of the people who once worked here. The former C\u0026H General Office Building now serves as the Keweenaw National Historical Park Headquarters. The National Park Service also owns the former C\u0026H Public Library and the former C\u0026H Warehouse Number 1.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/kewe/learn/historyculture/industrial-calumet.htm","title":"Keweenaw National Historical Park: Industrial Calumet"}
