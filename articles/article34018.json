{"body":"Virtual Tour Stop, Howison Hill         Artillery on Howison Hill. The cannon on the left is a large 30 pounder Parrott.   Like Lee\u0027s Hill, Howison Hill was crowned with Confederate artillery that blasted the Union attackers in front of Marye\u0027s Heights. A large 30 pounder Parrot was among the guns at this location. This type of gun is classified as siege artillery and not usually found on a battlefield. Besides one here, the Confederates had one on Lee\u0027s Hill.       As you proceed south along Lee Drive, the route parallels earthworks dug by Confederate soldiers, mostly after the battle was over. It was this strong trench line that convinced General Hooker to bypass this position in what became the Chancellorsville Campaign.         You will also pass interpretive signs and battle maps.        Proceed to Virtual Tour Stop, Bernard\u0027s Cabin Trail","url":"https://www.nps.gov/frsp/learn/photosmultimedia/howisonhill.htm","title":"Fredericksburg \u0026 Spotsylvania National Military Park: Howison Hill"}
