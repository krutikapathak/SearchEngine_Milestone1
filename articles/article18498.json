{"body":"Engineer Benjamin Wright         Benjamin Wright Wikimedia commons  Benjamin Wright is recognized as the \"Father of American Civil Engineering\". A country lawyer and surveyor, he became an engineer by experience, not training. He served with great distinction as the chief engineer of the Erie Canal. Two weeks before construction began on the C\u0026O Canal, the canal company board of directors hired Wright to serve in the same capacity. Construction of the C\u0026O Canal proved to be more arduous than the Erie because it had to contend with mountains, rivers and the railroad. The marvels of the C\u0026O Canal, including the Monocacy Aqueduct, serve as testimonies to Wright\u0027s engineering skills.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/choh/learn/historyculture/engineerbenjaminwright.htm","title":"Chesapeake \u0026 Ohio Canal National Historical Park: Benjamin Wright"}
