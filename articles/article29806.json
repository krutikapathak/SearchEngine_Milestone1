{"body":"Eugene Viollet-le-Duc         A portrait of Eugene Viollet-le-Duc. National Park Service, Statue of Liberty NM  Eugene Viollet-le-Duc, born on January 21, 1814 in Paris, France, was the first architect hired to design the internal structure of the Statue of Liberty. He was hired by Auguste Bartholdi, the sculptor of the Statue of Liberty, who was one of Viollet-le-Duc\u0027s former students. In his designs, Viollet-le-Duc wanted to rely solely on sheer weight to support the Statue\u0027s 62,000 pounds of copper skin. Therefore, he suggested that sand-filled masonry compartments be constructed within the Statue. Viollet-le-Duc also advised Bartholdi to sculpt the Statue\u0027s skin using the repoussé technique - the process of molding light-weight copper sheets by hammering them onto the Statue\u0027s wooden framework. Once molded, these sheets would be attached to each other with the use of armature bars. Lastly, Viollet-le-Duc helped Bartholdi design Miss Liberty\u0027s torch and the support system for her arm. When Viollet-le-Duc died unexpectedly on September 17, 1879, Bartholdi turned to Gustave Eiffel to design the Statue\u0027s internal structure. Viollet-le-Duc\u0027s ideas however were not forgotten or unappreciated. Although Eiffel designed a completely new support system for the Statue, Viollet-le-Duc\u0027s brilliant armature bar usage and repoussé technique were retained.        Back to People","url":"https://www.nps.gov/stli/learn/historyculture/eugene-viollet-le-duc.htm","title":"Statue Of Liberty National Monument: Eugene Viollet-le-Duc"}
