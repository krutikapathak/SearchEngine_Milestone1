Works such as the \"Standing Lincoln\" monument and the Shaw Memorial, continue to inspire people today and his design for the 1907 Twenty Dollar Gold Piece, is considered America\u0027s most beautiful coin.  A database featuring a wide variety of Saint-Gaudens\u0027 works is available on the web site of the Friends of Saint-Gaudens, an organization dedicated to preserving the artistic legacy of the sculptor. Over ten different foreign language translations of the park\u0027s brochure are available.  Over 100 works of the sculptor are exhibited in the galleries and on the grounds at Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site. The papers of Augustus Saint-Gaudens are housed in the special collections of Rauner Library at Dartmouth College, Hanover, N.H., 20 miles north of the park.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/saga/learn/historyculture/index.htm","title":"Saint-Gaudens National Historic Site: History \u0026 Culture"}
