Healthy Park, Healthy Communities is an Olympic National Park initiative to promote the health and well-being of our local communities and help reconnect people with nature in a way that is beneficial to humans, as well as our surrounding ecosystem. National parks are a natural \u0027fit\u0027 for improved health and enhanced quality of life. Whether it\u0027s engaging youth in exercise or connecting with nature, partnering with medical professionals, or bringing a park experience to those with disabilities, national parks and programs like America\u0027s Great Outdoors Initiative and Healthy Parks, Healthy People are inspiring the movement to get outside and get healthy on our public lands.             Park Prescription Olympic\u0027s new Park Prescription program allows physicians to write prescriptions for a \u0027walk in the park\u0027 to patients needing the mental or physical benefits of outdoor recreation. A doctor-prescribed Olympic Prescription will allow people a seven-day entrance pass into Olympic National Park.               Bark Rangers  Well-behaved dogs are invited to bring their human companions and become official Olympic National Park Bark Rangers!
