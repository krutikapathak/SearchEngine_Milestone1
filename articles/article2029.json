{"body":"Melhok Ki       Tumacácori National Historical Park contracted with representatives of the O\u0027odham Nation in 1997 to build a traditional Melhok Ki (pronounced moo\u0027 rok kee), an O\u0027odham dwelling and its adjoining ramada, both made of mesquite timbers, ocotillo sticks, and mud. The National Park Service did this to so that visitors could see the traditional way in which the O\u0027odham lived prior to the arrival of the Spanish and other Europeans. Once the Ki was complete, the park preservation crew took on its maintenance  and preservation.       Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp        Photo by Jana Tschopp","url":"https://www.nps.gov/tuma/learn/historyculture/melhok-ki.htm","title":"Tumacácori National Historical Park: Melhok Ki"}
