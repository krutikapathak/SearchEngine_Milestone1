{"body":"Ancestral Pueblo People - Vital Statistics         Hours spent kneeling and grinding corn took their toll on Ancestral Pueblo knees and arms. NPS Photo by Sally King  Size The average Ancestral Pueblo man was 5\u00275\" tall while the average woman was 5\u0027. The average size for people in Europe was approximately the same. Lifespan The average lifespan was 35 years; however, infant mortality rates were high. A large percentage of children never made it past 2 years of age. There would have been individuals who survived into their 50\u0027s and 60\u0027s but they would not be among the majority. Health Bad teeth and arthritis were common ailments. It was not uncommon for women to die in childbirth. Evidence suggests that injured persons were nursed and supported by the community.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/band/learn/historyculture/ancestral-pueblo-people-vital-statistics.htm","title":"Bandelier National Monument: Vital Statistics"}
