{"body":"Trailwide       Diary of Dr. Rowland Willard Dr. Rowland Willard was a physician who traveled west along the Santa Fe Trail in 1825 - just four years after William Becknell opened the trail. Willard left St. Charles, Missouri in May of that year and by early July was in Taos, New Mexico. After a summer-long sojourn there, he headed south along El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. He crossed the Jornada del Muerto in mid-October, continued south, and arrived in Chihuahua on November 5. Often serving as the Chihuahua\u0027s only doctor, he remained in the city until early 1827, when the diary ends. Willard\u0027s diary details the conditions along both the Santa Fe Trail and El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro. In addition, his diary provides a revealing glimpse into the medical procedures employed during the 1820s and of the physician\u0027s status in frontier society. Two recently drawn maps (one for each trail) help the reader follow the progress of Willard\u0027s travels. Willard\u0027s diary resides at Yale University\u0027s Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library. Historian Joy Poole transcribed Willard\u0027s diary, after which she and Ben Brown provided extensive annotations that increase the reader\u0027s understanding of Willard\u0027s diary entries.
