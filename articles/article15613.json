{"body":"Officers\u0027 Row         Commanding Officer\u0027s Quarters NPS  Just as the barracks were designed with four companies in mind, the company officers\u0027 quarters were also designed to house four companies\u0027 worth of officers. A typical company\u0027s officers included two lieutenants and one captain. As such, the officer\u0027s quarters were divided into two halls, each with four rooms; a lieutenant was housed in one room while captains could claim two. In the rear of each half of the building was a kitchen and servant\u0027s quarters.        Lieutenant\u0027s Quarters NPS  Officers got several perks that came with their rank. In addition to higher pay and access to some better food, officers could live with their families on post, afford to hire servants, and had the means and education to pursue more sophisticated activities in their leisure time. Books, taxidermy, and music are among the leisure activities in which you might notice the officers take interest based on the furnishings. Officers\u0027 wives could look forward to a life of leisure at the post, but often found themselves bored by the monotony of the frontier post and its limited opportunities for socializing and entertainment.      Go to Next Building, Go to Previous Building, or choose a building from the map below.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/fols/learn/photosmultimedia/officers-row.htm","title":"Fort Larned National Historic Site: Officers\u0027 Row"}
