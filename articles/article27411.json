Congress stated in the park\u0027s enabling legislation that Minuteman Missile\u0027s purpose is \"to interpret the historical role of the Minuteman II missile defense system as a key component of America\u0027s strategic commitment to preserve world peace and in the broader context of the Cold War.\"  The structures and landscapes at Minuteman Missile National Historic Site serve as an ideal location to explore the people, places and stories that illustrate the experience of Air Force personnel, local landowners and residents of the Great Plains who worked at or lived around Minuteman Missile sites for the last three decades of the Cold War. The historic resources at Minuteman Missile that tell this story are protected and preserved to the highest professional standards for the enjoyment of present and future generations.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/learn/historyculture/index.htm","title":"Minuteman Missile National Historic Site: History \u0026 Culture"}
