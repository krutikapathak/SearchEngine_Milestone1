{"body":"Directions Using GPS or Internet Mapping Applications       If you can enter a location into your GPS unit based on the location\u0027s latitudinal and longitudinal geographic coordinates, use either the decimal degrees (DD) or degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS) coordinates listed below. Otherwise... Warning about using internet mapping applications for locations in Point Reyes based on street addresses: If you use an internet mapping application (i.e., Google Maps, MapQuest, Yahoo! Maps) or a GPS unit to obtain directions based on street addresses, please be aware that most GPS systems and internet mapping applications provide incorrect placement of points of interest within Point Reyes National Seashore when the location\u0027s postal address is entered into the search field. If you are using an internet mapping application or a GPS unit that does not accept latitudinal and longitudinal geographic coordinates, try entering the addresses listed below. If using \"Inverness, CA 94937\" doesn\u0027t appear to give an appropriate location, try \"Point Reyes Station, CA 94956\" for the City, State, and Zip Code instead. NOTE: The U.S. Postal Service does not recognize these addresses for delivery purposes. These addresses should get you close enough to the appropriate location that you will have seen old-fashioned road signs upon which you can rely to ultimately get you to your desired destination. Disclaimer: The National Park Service does not guarantee that these addresses will provide the correct location for all internet mapping applications and GPS systems.
