The river enters the northern corridor as a free-flowing prairie river and moves downstream to plunge over St. Anthony Falls and into the river\u0027s narrowest gorge. Eight and one-half miles later, the river exits the gorge to become the country\u0027s dominant floodplain river and part of the largest inland navigation system on earth.    Through the eight and one-half mile gorge, the Mississippi drops more than 110 feet, the river\u0027s steepest descent anywhere. The river\u0027s rapidly changing character explains why the national river and recreation area has such a unique concentration of nationally significant resources.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/miss/learn/index.htm","title":"Mississippi National River \u0026 Recreation Area: Learn About the Park"}
