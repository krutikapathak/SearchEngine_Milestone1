Â        2012 Youth Engagement Video Roger Williams National Memorial was one of 49 national parks that participated in the 2012 America\u0027s Best Idea program sponsored by the National Park Foundation, the official charity of America\u0027s national parks. Inspired by the critically-acclaimed Ken Burns documentary The National Parks: America\u0027s Best Idea, the America\u0027s Best Idea grant program funds park projects designed to connect diverse, under-engaged populations throughout the United States with their national parks in innovative and meaningful ways.     \"The support from the National Park Foundation\u0027s America\u0027s Best Idea program allowed us to expand an existing partnership with our community partners, The Steel Yard and Groundwork Providence, and engage 15 local teens in the story of Roger Williams and his legacy through the creation of a speakers\u0027 corner now sited at the Memorial,\" stated Jennifer Smith, Site Manager of Roger Williams National Memorial. \"We were also able to introduce the teens, through a National Park Service exploration component of the summer-long program, to nearby National Park Service units and a diversity of career opportunities available to them. We would not have been able to offer such a comprehensive experience to the teens without this critical funding from the National Park Foundation.\"     The park\u0027s 2012 summer youth program, A Place for Ideas: A Speakers\u0027 Corner for Roger Williams National Memorial, supported, in part, by the America\u0027s Best Idea grant program culminated with a community celebration on September 14th and the unveiling of a speakers\u0027 corner and three lightboxes highlighting environmental stewardship projects undertaken as part of the eight week program.
