{"body":"Virtual Tour Stop, Chewning Farm        On the high plateau in the background of this photo lay the Chewning Farm, another small farm dotting the Wilderness landscape. The farm stood on key ground between General Richard Ewell\u0027s Confederates on the Orange Turnpike and General A.P. Hill\u0027s Southerners on the Orange Plank Road.         A dirt lane leads from the parking area to the site of the Chewning House and plateau.         On the morning of May 5, General Samuel Crawford\u0027s Union division followed the Parker\u0027s Store Road southwesterly onto the Chewning Plateau. They looked down upon General A.P. Hill\u0027s Corps advancing eastward on the Orange Plank Road. Instead of slamming into Hill\u0027s column or fortifying this key ground, Crawford\u0027s men were recalled to support the attacks on the Orange Turnpike.         Confederates of A.P. Hill\u0027s Corps later occupied the Chewning Plateau, but were soon directed to reinforce Hill\u0027s men on the Orange Plank Road. On May 6, General Ambrose Burnside\u0027s Corps was ordered to retake this key ground, but were unable to do so.           Coninue to Virtual Tour Stop, Tapp Field","url":"https://www.nps.gov/frsp/learn/photosmultimedia/chewningf.htm","title":"Fredericksburg \u0026 Spotsylvania National Military Park: Chewning Farm"}
