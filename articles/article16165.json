Under the ADA, service animals must be harnessed, leashed, or tethered, unless these devices interfere with the service animal\u0027s work or the individual\u0027s disability prevents using these devices. In that case, the individual must maintain control of the dog through voice, signal, or other effective controls. Dogs should also be housebroken.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/fosc/planyourvisit/service-animals.htm","title":"Fort Scott National Historic Site: Service Animals"}
