{"body":"Historic Events       1867 and 1868 were Fort Larned\u0027s most consequential years. In the spring of 1867, General Hancock blundered into war with the Cheyenne, a season of fighting known as Hancock\u0027s War. That conflict ended with the pivotal Medicine Lodge Treaty in October, 1867, which Fort Larned supplied. The following year, the gifts promised by the treaty were distributed at Fort Larned.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/fols/learn/historyculture/historic-events.htm","title":"Fort Larned National Historic Site: Historic Events"}
