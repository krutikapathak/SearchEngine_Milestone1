Photo by: Heiko von Raußendorff        Muir and Today\u0027s National Park System  Muir\u0027s love for wild nature aided the creation of several national parks. Our National Parks (1901), a collection of articles he wrote for the Atlantis Monthly about Yellowstone, Yosemite, Sequoia, and General Grant (now part of Kind\u0027s Canyon) national parks, is still in print.       The battle for conservation will go on endlessly. It is the universal warfare between right and wrong. -John Muir, 1896       Muir\u0027s Conservation Legacy Lives On  \"Why should man value himself as more than a small part of the one great unit of creation?\" John Muir asked. His remarkable vision – that all creation is one community made up of equal companions – still inspires people to love nature and to work to save wildlands and wildlife. Muir is often called the father of national parks and forest reservations, forerunners of national forests. Muir urged people to experience wild nature so they would be inspired to defend it and save it.   At the University of Wisconsin, Muir read Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau on nature. He studied Louis Agassiz\u0027s new geology and Asa Gray\u0027s plant science. Later, he used these tools to achieve success in conservation. Muir arrived in California in 1868. He lived in the Yosemite area of the southern Sierra Range off and on for several years, and studied its botany and geology. In 1871, in an article in the New York Tribune, Muir argued that glaciers had carved Yosemite Valley. California\u0027s state geologist ridiculed his views, which were substantially correct. After five years as an active fruit rancher, Muir began his most important campaign to preserve the American wilderness. Muir enraged critics with the charge that lumbermen and sheepherders, with their \"hoofed locusts,\" were ruining Yosemite\u0027s wildness. He attacked the prevailing notion that nature existed only to provide commodities for humans. With Century magazine editor Robert Underwood Johnson, Muir pushed for the creation of Yosemite National Park. His magazine and newspaper articles helped change Americans\u0027 attitude toward wilderness and wildness. After Muir\u0027s death, his journals and other writings provided material for many more books.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/jomu/learn/historyculture/places.htm","title":"John Muir National Historic Site: Places"}
