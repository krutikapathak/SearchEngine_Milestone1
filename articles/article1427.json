There are many lodging options in the nearby communities of Estes Park and Grand Lake.    Camping  Rocky has five established campgrounds, four of which are open to tent or vehicle camping (tent trailers, pickup campers, trailers, and motorhomes) and one that can only be used by tent campers. Reservations are strongly suggested during the busy summer and fall months. Visitors may also camp in the park\u0027s spectacular wilderness. Permits are required.    Restaurants \u0026 Grocery Stores  From approximately late May through early October, there is one restaurant inside the park. The Trail Ridge Store includes a caf√© and coffee bar adjacent to the Alpine Visitor Center along Trail Ridge Road. There are no grocery stores in Rocky Mountain National Park. The Rocky Mountain Conservancy sells very limited food items in the park visitor centers and bottled water at Bear Lake and Park \u0026 Ride during summer and fall.    Restaurants and grocery stores can be found in the local communities of Grand Lake and Estes Park.    Picnic Areas  If you prefer to bring your own food into the park, there are several areas for picnicking that provide tables, and sometimes restrooms and fire grates. All picnic areas are first-come, first-served and most can be found on the park map.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/romo/planyourvisit/eatingsleeping.htm","title":"Rocky Mountain National Park: Eating \u0026 Sleeping"}
