Congratulations Kate!My Hawai\u0027i, is an annual environmental writing contest for middle school students in Grades 6, 7 and 8 from across the state. The top 25 poems and short stories were selected from more than 360 submissions and will be published in an anthology that is distributed to schools and libraries statewide. The students\u0027 writing represents personal reflections on the environment, cultural values, kuleana, stewardship, and place-based writing, and contributes to a collection of youth literature that is unique to Hawai\u0027i. To date, 225 middle school students have had their stories and poems on the environment published! While academic testing provides a measure of content knowledge, creative writing can capture students\u0027 thoughts, passions, beliefs, and values.The My Hawai\u0027i Story Contest provides an educational approach that develops interdisciplinary thinkers. Many of the stories and poems include knowledge from diverse backgrounds and provide good examples of successful collaborations that integrate traditional cultural values and contemporary life in Hawai\u0027i. The imaginative visions of middle school students reveal their insights on Hawaii\u0027s environment today and their dreams for tomorrow. The future of conservation and environmental leadership lies firmly in the hands our haumana, the young people of Hawai\u0027i. This important initiative encourages, nurtures, cultivates, and promotes future generations to develop a sense of responsibility to care for and protect Hawaii\u0027s environment.For the past nine years the Pacific Writers\u0027 Connection (PWC), the Hawai\u0027i Conservation Alliance, and the following state and federal agencies, have co-sponsored the My Hawai\u0027i Story Contest:Hawai\u0027i Coastal Zone Management ProgramHawai\u0027i Conservation AllianceHawai\u0027i Conservation Alliance FoundationHawai\u0027i Department of EducationHawai\u0027i Department of Land and Natural Resources - Division of Forestry and Wildlife and Division of Aquatic ResourcesHawai\u0027i Environmental Education AllianceNational Park Service - Hawai\u0027i Volcanoes National Park and Friends of Hawai\u0027i Volcanoes National ParkNational Oceanic and Atmospheric AdministrationPapahānaumokuākea Marine National MonumentFor more information, please contact Dr. Takiora Ingram, cell: 808-781-6147 or email tingram.raro@gmail.com or Molly Mamaril, email mamaril@hawaii.edu","url":"https://www.nps.gov/havo/learn/kidsyouth/2015_my_hawaii.htm","title":"Hawai\u0027i Volcanoes National Park: My Hawai‘i Story Contest 2015"}
