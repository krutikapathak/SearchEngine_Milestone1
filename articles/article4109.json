{"body":"Amphibians         Southern leopard frog. NPS photo  In the Everglades, the fine line between water and land often blurs. Consequently, the park serves as the perfect habitat for a number of amphibious species. Frogs and toads are particularly conspicuous and routinely serenade the landscape with a loud and unusual chorus.             Amphibian Chorus     Listen to a chorus of amphibians recorded at Shark Valley, which is located in the northern part of the park and accessible from the south side of the Tamiami Trail.
