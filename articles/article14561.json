On October 30,1735, John Adams was born in this humble cottage. In this quiet rural setting where his father tilled his acreage during the summer and practiced the trade of cordwaining in winter, the nation\u0027s second president grew to manhood. John\u0027s father, Deacon John Adams (1692-1761), instilled in his oldest son a strong interest in municipal affairs and farming and a respect for God. John\u0027s mother, Susanna Boylston (1709-1797), came from one of Massachusetts\u0027 most prominent families and introduced her son to the customs and lifestyles of the elite of colonial Boston. Upon his father\u0027s death in 1761, john\u0027s brother Peter Boylston Adams inherited the original homestead. The adjacent house, which Deacon John purchased in 1744, was bequeathed to John. The future second president eventually bought his birthplace from his brother in 1774. John and Abigail Adams lived next door and rented out this house during the Revolutionary War.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/adam/learn/historyculture/john-adams-birthplace.htm","title":"Adams National Historical Park: John Adams Birthplace"}
