{"body":"Steamboat Geyser              Tucked away in the Norris Geyser Basin is Steamboat Geyser, the world\u0027s tallest active geyser. Its major eruptions shoot water more than 300 feet (91 m). Only Waimangu Geyser in New Zealand has rocketed to greater heights—but not in more than one hundred years. In Yellowstone National Park\u0027s recorded history, only two other geysers have exceeded Steamboat in size: Excelsior Geyser in Midway Geyser Basin and Sapphire Pool in Biscuit Basin. Steamboat\u0027s minor and major eruptions are entirely unpredictable.  \u003c Previous Stop | Next Stop \u003e","url":"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/photosmultimedia/norris-tour-steamboat-geyser.htm","title":"Yellowstone National Park: Steamboat Geyser"}
