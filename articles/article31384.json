Many laws, including the 1916 Organic Act that created the National Park Service, affect all areas managed by the National Park Service. Rio Grande Wild \u0026 Scenic River legislation is listed in the 1968 Wild \u0026 Scenic Rivers Act and Amendments. There are a variety of documents that guide the management of the Rio Grande Wild \u0026 Scenic River. Many documents, like the National Environmental Policy Act, articulate legal requirements that federal entities must adhere to. Other documents, like the park\u0027s General Management Plan and Superintendent\u0027s Compendium, are formal documents that create a \"contract\" between Big Bend National Park and Rio Grande Wild \u0026 Scenic River and the public. Still others, like Director\u0027s and Superintendent Orders, direct how Big Bend and the Rio Grande Wild \u0026 Scenic River and other national park units will operate.      Park Regulations The Code of Federal Regulations and the Superintendent\u0027s Compendium provide a complete listing of park rules and regulations. These specific rules are developed with public input to implement applicable law.   36 CFR parts 1-199 (Code of Federal Regulations) pertains to all National Park areas. Superintendent\u0027s Compendium provides a listing of park-specific regulations under the discretionary authority of the superintendent.
