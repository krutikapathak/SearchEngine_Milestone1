Its namesake arches mingle with spires, balanced rocks, thin sandstone fins and undulating fields of ancient lithified sand dunes, to list just a few of the park\u0027s many landscapes.  But that rocky foundation supports a wide variety of ecosystems filled with desert life. From the microscopic communities of biological soil crust, to the unexpected aquatic oases of desert potholes, to the undeniable power of the Colorado River that forms the park\u0027s southeast boundary -- life abounds in every corner of the park.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/nature/naturalfeaturesandecosystems.htm","title":"Arches National Park: Natural Features \u0026 Ecosystems"}
