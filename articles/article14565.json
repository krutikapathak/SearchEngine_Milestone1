Visitors enjoyed a display of ten books that ranged from a French copy of Cicero signed by a 10-year-old John Quincy Adams to a work on judicial reform given to Adams by the British philosopher Jeremy Bentham. Collectively, the books provide a tangible view into John Quincy\u0027s interests and his passionate pursuit of knowledge. From the front end of his career timeline, the compact Epitres ou Lettres Familiers et Choisies de Ciceron bears the inscription, \"John Quincy Adams His book 1778.\" The work stands as a starting point not just for the display but Adams\u0027 education broadly construed. Cicero would prove to be a, if not the, driving influence in Adams\u0027 public service career, and he would return to the Roman orator\u0027s words at distinct stages in his career. Adams drew heavily on Cicero while working as the Boylston Professor of Rhetoric at Harvard from 1806-09, as well as his later life while serving as the last vestige of the American Revolution in his post-Presidential career in the House of Representatives. As the Epitres de Ciceron highlights John Quincy Adams\u0027 early interest in both the classics and language studies, Platonis Philosophi Quae Exstant Graece and Editionem from 1781 extends the point, as the book is written in both ancient Greek and Latin. Such dual language works give clear credence to Adams\u0027 well documented linguistic dexterity. Ecclesiastical History of New England was used by Adams in preparation for his 1843 address to the Massachusetts Historical Society on the bicentennial of the New England Confederation. That address demonstrated Adams\u0027 consideration of the interplay of religion and politics in New England that thrust the region onto the world stage, a theme upon which his grandson, Brooks Adams, would later attempt to expand. An 1833 copy of Emanuel Swedenborg\u0027s Delights of Wisdom Concerning Conjugal Love and the famous Mendi Bible from John Quincy Adams\u0027 1841 Supreme Court victory in the Amistad case demonstrate the range of Adams\u0027 spiritual sensibilities from the Classical Age to the Second Great Awakening. John Quincy Adams\u0027 exhibited books include his 1812 copy of Hester Chapone\u0027s  Letters on the Improvement of the Mind which proposed a multi-disciplinary approach to the education of young women far beyond domestic arts and sentimental novels. Adams\u0027 own interdisciplinary interests stretched from the early science fiction and political satire of Virginian George Tucker\u0027s 1827 A Voyage to the Moon (inscribed \"For the President of the United States from the Author\") to an 1829 copy of Samuel Kettell\u0027s  Specimens of American Poetry.   At his core, Adams was, however, a political being and his reformist and progressive tendencies were illustrated by his copy of Draught of a Code for the Organization of the Judicial Establishment by Jeremy Bentham given to John Quincy Adams in 1817, and Edward Livingston\u0027s System of Penal Law given to Quincy Adams by the author in the 1830s. Of course, these collected works barely scratch the surface of the library\u0027s treasures, but are an incredibly useful primer to better understand the diversity and complexity to John Quincy Adams\u0027 full collection.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/adam/learn/historyculture/research.htm","title":"Adams National Historical Park: Research"}
