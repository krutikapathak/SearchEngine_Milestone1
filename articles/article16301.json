{"body":"Blue Geyser          Â    Blue Geyser was called Iris Spring in 1886. Due to a misread map label, in 1904 the feature was inadvertently given its current name. It was observed to erupt to heights of over 60 feet from 1993 to 1996. It became almost dormant in 1997 and has remained very quiet ever since. Blue Geyser\u0027s last observed eruption was in February of 1997.  \u003c Previous Stop | Next Stop \u003e","url":"https://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/photosmultimedia/norris-tour-blue-geyser.htm","title":"Yellowstone National Park: Blue Geyser"}
