{"body":"Sensitive Species       While all native wildlife species at Pinnacles National Park are protected, some warrant special attention. In many cases they have been listed by other agencies as Endangered, Threatened, or Species of Special Concern. Species endemic to the Pinnacles area are also listed here because even though they may not currently be in trouble, much of their known range falls within our boundaries.
