Junior Rangers are special kids of all ages just like you - adventurers, explorers, and nature and history lovers. They have made a special promise to help take care of national parks and all the plants and animals that live there. Junior Rangers teach others by sharing all they learn with their friends and family. You too can set a shining example and inspire others to take care of Badlands\u0027 natural and cultural wonders by becoming a Badlands Junior Ranger.        Enjoy a hike down the Cliff Shelf Nature Trail.
