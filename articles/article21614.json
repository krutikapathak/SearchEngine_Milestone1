Dena\u0027ina Athabascans, Yup\u0027ik, Russian explorers, gold prospectors and trappers, and American pioneers are the forebears of today\u0027s residents.      The Dena\u0027ina Athabascan People  Alaska Natives settled in this region some time after the close of the Last Great Ice Age -- 14,000 years ago. Dena\u0027ina, Alutiiq, Yup\u0027ik and other groups have interacted with one another over the centuries, through warfare as well as trading and peaceable exchanges. Today, six Resident Zone Communities are identified for Lake Clark National Park and Preserve.

Proenneke The source of Sam Keith\u0027s book, One Man\u0027s Wilderness: An Alaskan Odyssey, Richard Louis Proenneke (1916-2003) embodies humanity\u0027s fascination with wilderness.  Born in Iowa, he worked as a farmhand and rancher before joining the Navy the day after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In 1949, he made his first visit to Alaska at the invitation of a friend. Two decades later, Proenneke set off on a path toward a life defined by the struggles and triumphs of a life lived in wilderness.
