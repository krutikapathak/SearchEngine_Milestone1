An alternate route along Kautz Creek Trail also goes to Indian Henry\u0027s Hunting Ground.   The trailhead is located across the street from the museum and main parking area, on the same side of the road as the Administration Building. The trail begins at Longmire and joins the Wonderland Trail approximately 0.1 mile above Longmire. In another 0.1 mile the trail crosses the Longmire/Paradise road and enters old growth forest and climbs somewhat steeply for 1.7 miles to the junction with the Rampart Ridge Trail.  From there the trail descends to Kautz Creek, with a log bridge crossing. Note: Washouts of this log bridge are not uncommon, so it is recommended to inquire about the status of this crossing at a Wilderness Center or Ranger Station before leaving.  After about 1.3 miles, the trail reaches Pyramid Creek Camp. From there it ascends via a series of switchbacks, crosses Fisher\u0027s Hornpipe Creek, and traverses along a ridge to Devil\u0027s Dream Camp (5 miles from Longmire). The trail then rises gradually for another mile before reaching the ranger patrol cabin in the meadows of Indian Henry\u0027s. NOTE: Always check current trail conditions before heading out. Log footbridges frequently wash out during the winter or other conditions could be affecting the trail.  Along the Trail Kautz Creek is a popular lunch break by travelers, as is Pyramid Creek (just past the Pyramid Creek Camp). From Pyramid Creek to Devil\u0027s Dream the trail is mainly in old growth forest. Just before Devil\u0027s Dream Camp a stream has carved a deep narrow canyon. This stream is commonly used as a water source for hikers and campers. Shortly after passing Devil\u0027s Dream Camp the trail reaches the beautiful Squaw Lake area with small meadows and partial views of Iron Mountain.  From there the trail passes several small streams and meadows and soon reaches the large meadows of Indian Henry\u0027s Hunting Ground. About ¼ mile beyond the ranger cabin is the trail to Mirror Lake (0.7 mile) and the base of Pyramid Peak. From Indian Henry\u0027s, the Wonderland Trail descends to Tahoma Creek and the suspension bridge leading to Emerald Ridge and South Puyallup River Camp.  Indian Henry\u0027s is noted for its magnificent displays of flowers which begin typically in mid-July and extend into late August. In September and October these meadows also have impressive fall colors. Backpacking Permits are required for all overnight backcountry travel. Permits, camp locations, and regulations for backcountry travel may be obtained from the Longmire Wilderness Information Center, ranger stations, and visitor centers. Backpackers may camp at Pyramid Creek three miles from Longmire, or Devil\u0027s Dream 5 miles from Longmire.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/mora/planyourvisit/indian-henrys-longmire.htm","title":"Mount Rainier National Park: Indian Henry\u0027s-Longmire"}
