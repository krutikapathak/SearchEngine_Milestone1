He captured dozens of moments of camp life on grainy, black and white film: raising the flag, building a bridge, and just plain ol\u0027 goofing around. Shelia generously donated scans of the photos, as well as some original prints, for the park to share with researchers and visitors. Enjoy this glimpse into Arches\u0027 past.                   Arches CCC Photos   11 Photos  A collection of photos taken by Dorris \"Doc\" Bumgarner at the Arches CCC camp, circa 1939-1941","url":"https://www.nps.gov/arch/learn/historyculture/ccc-photos.htm","title":"Arches National Park: Arches CCC Photos"}
