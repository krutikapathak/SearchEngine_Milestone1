{"body":"2008 27th Annual Sand Sculpture Contest        Adult/Family Group 1st Place Winner: Entry #40: Ganesh, by Peter Bridgman        The 27th Annual Sand Sculpture Contest at Drakes Beach was once again well attended with 60 sculptures entered. Thousands of participants and observers showed up to enjoy a sunny, but windy day. Unfortunately, a high tide occurred shortly after noon, quickly washing away many of the sculptures.
