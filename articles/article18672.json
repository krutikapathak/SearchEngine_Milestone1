The Museum Collection The basis of the museum collection at Ford\u0027s Theatre National Historic Site is the Osborn H. Oldroyd Lincoln Collection, which Mr. Oldroyd set up in the Petersen House in 1892.  The collection contained over 3,000 items and was augmented by those artifacts related to the assassination used as state\u0027s evidence in the trial of the conspirators.  Oldroyd maintained his collection in the Petersen House after the purchase of the house by the federal government in 1896.  The government purchased the collection itself from Oldroyd in 1926 for the sum of $50,000. Museum items include Lincoln\u0027s overcoat, Booth\u0027s derringer, Major Rathbone\u0027s gloves and the contents of Lincoln\u0027s pockets when he was killed.","url":"https://www.nps.gov/foth/learn/historyculture/index.htm","title":"Ford\u0027s Theatre: History \u0026 Culture"}
