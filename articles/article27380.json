Academic scholarship and popular histories have done much to illuminate this history, but there are still many topics that have yet to receive in-depth coverage.  As nostalgia for the Cold War grows and the population which lived during that era continues to mature, an outpouring of new works should be expected. The  selections listed here stand out for their combination of historical accuracy and readability. We\u0027ve divided the bibliography into the following categories for ease of use:   General Cold War History Soviet Union and the Cold War The Cuban Missile Crisis Minuteman Missiles \u0026 Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles History Nuclear Weapons \u0026 The Nuclear Arms Race Nuclear Weapons Accidents Online References","url":"https://www.nps.gov/mimi/learn/historyculture/bibliography.htm","title":"Minuteman Missile National Historic Site: Bibliography"}
